<p>⚠️ This page is Under Construction
<p>Hi, I'm Nathan Nadler-Nir
<br>a designer, filmmaker, and creative technologist building digital gardens.</p>
<p>I work across media, from video, illustration and 3D to UX/UI and Web. Whether I'm shaping a brand, producing a documentary, or sketching out a product, I always put people at the center of the process.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've:
<br>🎬 Produced mountains of film and video content with companies, collaborators & arts festivals
<br>🚀 Led the creative strategy of tech startups like Momint and Dado  
<br>💻 Developed custom web experiences for international clients
<br>🧠 Specialized in creative execution, story structure, and productivity systems (I love Notion)</p>
<p>My practice balances highly efficient problem solving with the joy of experimentation, it's grounded in collaboration, fuelled by curiosity, and informed by a lifelong fascination with digital tools.</p>
